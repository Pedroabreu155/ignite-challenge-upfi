This project helped me to consolidate knowledge on React and Next fundamentals like:

- React Query
- Fauna DB
- ImageBB

About React Query I learned how is important save data as cache to perform our databases queries and gave more softness to the App, this improve user's experience at usage.

The tests was made by Rocketseat team, and the grade was gave by Rocketseat's platform!
